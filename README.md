`webpacker-pnpm` replaces Rails' Yarn environment with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), a better, smarter, and more efficient Node.js package manager. As a result, applications become less prone to dependency hell, more functional, more stable, and more flexible. And as an added bonus, dependency resolution times and `node_modules` folder sizes reduce to within reasonable ranges (not 45 seconds and 10 GiB).

You can read about the philosophy and technology behind `pnpm` in [this convincing blog post](https://www.kochan.io/nodejs/why-should-we-use-pnpm) by Zoltan Kochan (<https://www.kochan.io/nodejs/why-should-we-use-pnpm>).
